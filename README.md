# Money Saver

## Functionality
### What it deos
Our app is designed to help its users come up with effective plans for their mooney. For example if a user would like to see the return on a $500 investment with an interest rate of 5% all they would have to do is fill in the appropriate fields and click a button to get the return on investment.
### What technologies were used
To create the app we used html as well as css, and to stick with the halloween theme we made our app look a bit spooky. On the back end we used JavaScript to give functionality to all the buttons and to make the calculations. In addition to that we used github to make colabortion a little bit easier. 
### Challanges
We faced a few problems. One of the bigger ones was that most of our group (3/4) was relitevely new and inexperienced in making a software product of any kind. In addition, originally all the backend code was done in python. We didn't know how to connect html and python so we had to convert the python code into JavaScript which was quite a challange as our group only had a surface level understanding of the language.
