# Money Saver

## Functionality
#### What it deos
Our app is designed to help its users come up with effective plans for their mooney. For example if a user would like to see the return on a $500 investment with an interest rate of 5% all they would have to do is fill in the appropriate fields and click a button to get the return on investment.
#### What technologies were used
To create the app we used html, and to stick with the halloween theme we made our app look a bit spooky. On the back end we used JavaScript to give functionality to all the buttons and to make the calculations. In addition to that we used github to make colabortion a little bit easier. 
#### Challanges
